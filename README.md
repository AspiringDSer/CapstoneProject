# Capstone Project - Human Activity Recognition 

**Research Question:** Can we use Convolutional Neural Networks to identify an action in a video?

## Summary 

1. Human Activity Recognition - Final Report 

## Notebooks 

1. Human Activity Recognition - The Journey

   The first notebook where I explain my journey throughout the capstone project. 

2. Human Activity Recognition - Capstone Project 

   The second notebook that covers the technical component of the capstone project. 

## Data 

1. Dataset - The Dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php

   Once you finish extracting the dataset. Rename the folder to `UCF101`

1. envrequirements.txt                        
   
   Libaries needed to run the Notebooks. You can use the import enviroment feature in anaconda navigator and open the envrequirement.txt file to create an enviroment.
